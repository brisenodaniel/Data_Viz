## Honing a Research Question ##
- Often, you begin with a broad research question and then must narrow it
    - Example: Do 16-17 year olds have different additudes towards political participation than 18-19 year olds?
        - What do we mean by "political participation?"
        - What are the units of analysis?
        
## Data Sources for Different Units of Analysis ##
- Type of Analysis : Potential source
    - Individuals, families, households at one point of time : Cross - sectional surveys, census, microdata 
    - Following individuals over time : Longitudinal data
    - Small geographic area : Census aggregate data, neighborhood statistics
    - Countries over time : International time series (e.g., World Bank, GDP)

## An example ##
Smoke monitors were placed in the home of parents who are smokers, one in the living area and one in the child's bedroom
- What is the relationship between the two monitors? -> How does smoking in the living room affect concentrations in the child's bedroom -> Are elevated levels of smoke in the living area affecting air quality in the child's bedroom
